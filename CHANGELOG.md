### Fixes

-   Redirecting to auth when opening the default UI on `/auth/verify-email` with an unknown/deleted user instead of showing an empty screen
-   In case an error is thrown during loading session information/claim validation, `sessionContext` will now contain `doesSessionExist: false` instead of throwing an error

## [0.26.0] - 2022-09-14

### Added

-   Fixed rare error in an edge case where `getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom` was used by a sub-component of `SessionAuth`

### Breaking changes

-   Only supporting FDI 1.15
-   Backend SDKs have to be updated first to a version that supports session claims before enabling EmailVerification!
    -   supertokens-node: >= 12.0
    -   supertokens-golang: >= 0.9
    -   supertokens-python: >= 0.11
-   EmailVerification recipe is now not initialized as part of auth recipes. You can add it to the recipe list as `EmailVerification.init` like other recipes.
-   Removed `OFF` from possible `EmailVerification` recipe modes, default is updated to `REQUIRED`.
-   Moved email verification related styling options, events, overrides, pre-api hooks and redirection contexts into the `EmailVerification` recipe. You should configure them while initializing the `EmailVerification` recipe.
-   Removed recipe specific auth wrapper components. You should use `SessionAuth` instead.
-   Removed email verification methods from auth recipes. You should now call them on the `EmailVerification` recipe directly.
-   `requireAuth` now defaults to true in `SessionAuth` to match the behavior of the removed recipe specific wrappers.
-   Removed `redirectToLogin` from `SessionAuth`.
-   Moved `redirectToAuth` to SuperTokens out of auth recipes. You should now call `SuperTokens.redirectToAuth()` instead. In this function `redirectBack` defaults to `true`.
-   Removed `SIGN_IN_AND_UP` action from `GetRedirectionURLContext` of auth recipes. This should now be handled by passing a `getRedirectionURL` to `SuperTokens.init` that handles a context with the `TO_AUTH` action.

### Migration

#### EmailVerification recipe init

```ts
SuperTokens.init({
    // Normal init conf...
    recipeList: [
        EmailPassword.init({
            getRedirectionURL: (context) => {
                if (context.action === "SIGN_IN_AND_UP") {
                    // This handler should be moved to the SuperTokens.init level
                    return "/auth";
                }
                // All email verification related context should be now handled in the config of the EmailVerification recipe
            },
            onHandleEvent: () => {
                // Handle email verification related events here in the onHandleEvent of the EmailVerification config
            },
            preAPIHook: (context) => {
                // Move email verification related pre-API hooks into the preAPIHook of the EmailVerification config
            },
            postAPIHook: (context) => {
                // Move email verification related post-API hooks into the postAPIHook of the EmailVerification config
            }
            emailVerificationFeature: {
                mode: "REQUIRED",
                // Any other props here should be moved into the config of the EmailVerification recipe
            },
            override: {
                emailVerificationFeature: {
                    // These overrides should be moved into the config of the EmailVerification recipe
                }
            }
        }),
    ]
})
```

Should become:

```ts
SuperTokens.init({
    // Normal init conf...
    getRedirectionURL: (context) => {
        if (context.action === "TO_AUTH") {
            // Move handling the SIGN_IN_AND_UP action here
            return "/auth";
        }
    },
    recipeList: [
        EmailVerification.init({
            mode: "REQUIRED",
            // Props from emailVerificationFeature of the EmailPassword.init config should be moved here.
            override: {
                // The overrides from emailVerificationFeature in the overrides of the EmailPassword config should be moved here
            },

            getRedirectionURL: (context) => {
                // Move handling email verification related redirects here
            },
            onHandleEvent: () => {
                // Handle email verification related events here
            },
            preAPIHook: (context) => {
                // Move email verification related pre-API hooks here
            },
            postAPIHook: (context) => {
                // Move email verification related post-API hooks here
            },
        }),
        EmailPassword.init({}),
    ],
});
```

#### Auth wrappers

```tsx
function ProtectedHomeComponent() {
    return (
        <EmailPasswordAuth>
            <Home />
        </EmailPasswordAuth>
    );
}
```

Should become:

```tsx
function ProtectedHomeComponent() {
    return (
        <SessionAuth>
            <Home />
        </SessionAuth>
    );
}
```

## [0.25.1] - 2022-09-18

### Additions

-   Added `getRedirectURL` configuration option to third-party providers. This can be used to set where the user is redirected back during the callback.

### Breaking changes

-   SuperTokens components can now throw in case the server goes down. We advise adding an ErrorBoundary to provide a meaningful error screen. Please check here: https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html

## [0.24.8] - 2022-09-02

### Bug fixes

-   Input colors now follow `inputBackground` and `textInput` even while being pre-filled

### Changes

-   Updates `supertokens-node` version in example apps

## [0.24.7] - 2022-08-23

### Changes

### Bug fixes

-   Fixed clearing errors when switching between sign in & up in thirdpartyemailpassword

## [0.24.5] - 2022-08-16

### Changed

-   Sign in/up components now take a `redirectOnSessionExists` prop that controls if it redirects away if a session exists on mount. Defaults to true.
-   Adds unit tests to make sure that recipe functions are exported correctly

## [0.24.4] - 2022-08-07

-   Fixes styling issue for login with github

## [0.24.3] - 2022-08-05

### Fixed

-   Fixes https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/issues/523

## [0.24.0] - 2022-07-06

### Bug fixes

-   Fixes an issue where `userContext` would not get passed correctly for `ThirdPartyPasswordless` recipe

### Added

-   Added `SuperTokensWrapper` intended to wrap around whole applications, providing a session context

### Changed

-   Made auth wrappers SSR compatible

### Breaking changes

-   Added `loading` to the session context. Please check if the session context is still loading before using other props. `loading` is always false inside components wrapped by `AuthWrapper`s with `requireAuth=true`

### Migration

Following is an example of how your components may have to change. If you had components like this:

```tsx
// .... other imports
import SuperTokens, { getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom, SuperTokensWrapper } from "supertokens-auth-react";
import { useSessionContext } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
import { ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

function Component() {
    const sessionContext = useSessionContext();

    return <div className="fill">{sessionContext.doesSessionExist ? "logged in" : "logged out"}</div>;
}

SuperTokens.init({
    /* config... */
});

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <Router>
                <div className="fill">
                    <Routes>
                        {getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom(require("react-router-dom"))}
                        <Route
                            path="/some-path"
                            element={
                                <ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth requireAuth={true}>
                                    {/*
                                        In this case, Component will always display logged in.
                                        If doesSessionExist is false after the session is loaded, the user is redirected to the login screen
                                    */}
                                    <Component />
                                </ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>
                            }
                        />
                        <Route
                            path="/"
                            element={
                                <ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth requireAuth={false}>
                                    <Component />
                                </ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>
                            }
                        />
                    </Routes>
                </div>
            </Router>
        </div>
    );
}
```

It'd look like this after the update:

```tsx
// .... other imports
import SuperTokens, { getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom, SuperTokensWrapper } from "supertokens-auth-react";
import { useSessionContext } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
import { ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth } from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartyemailpassword";

function Component() {
    const sessionContext = useSessionContext();

    if (sessionContext.loading === true) {
        // You could display a loading screen here, but session context loading is very fast
        // so returning null is better in most cases to avoid content popping in and out
        return null;
    }

    return <div className="fill">{sessionContext.doesSessionExist ? "logged in" : "logged out"}</div>;
}

SuperTokens.init({
    /* config is unchanged */
});

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <SuperTokensWrapper>
                <Router>
                    <div className="fill">
                        <Routes>
                            {getSuperTokensRoutesForReactRouterDom(require("react-router-dom"))}
                            <Route
                                path="/some-path"
                                element={
                                    <ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth requireAuth={true}>
                                        {/* 
                                            In this case, Component will never hit the loading === true branch.
                                            It will only be rendered if `loading === false && doesSessionExist === true`
                                            If doesSessionExist is false after the session is loaded, the user is redirected to the login screen
                                        */}
                                        <Component />
                                    </ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth>
                                }
                            />
                            <Route path="/" element={<Component />} />
                        </Routes>
                    </div>
                </Router>
            </SuperTokensWrapper>
        </div>
    );
}
```

-   Changes recipe functions for passwordless recipe **(this is breaking change if you use the override feature)**:
    -   `getLinkCodeFromURL` -> NEW FUNCTION
    -   `getPreAuthSessionIdFromURL` -> NEW FUNCTION
-   Changes recipe functions for thirdpartpasswordless recipe : **(this is breaking change if you use the override feature)**:
    -   Changes for third party functions explained above
    -   Changes for passwordless recipe explained above
    -   `clearLoginAttemptInfo` -> RENAMED TO `clearPasswordlessLoginAttemptInfo`
-   Session recipe now uses supertokens-web-js internally (previously used supertokens-website)
-   All recipes now include a `postAPIHook` configuration parameter that can be used to respond to network actions.
-   General error handling for email verification components

### Breaking changes

1.  Updates function return types for all recipes to allow for custom API response handling when calling recipe functions manually
2.  All recipe functions now return an object which contains a `status` field along with other properties (instead of returning a boolean directly for example), to make function return types more consistent across recipes
3.  Updates signatures for functions exported from recipe/index to accept objects instead of params directly, to make function signatures consistent across all recipes
4.  Recipe config parameter `disableDefaultImplementation` has been renamed to `disableDefaultUI` to make the name more accurate to the effect the property has. This is applicable only if you are using the SDK with custom UI and disabling the pre-built UI that SuperTokens provides.

### Migration

1. Function return types now include a `fetchResponse` field for any function that makes a network request. If you override functions and return a custom object you will need to update your code to include a `fetchResponse` field that should be a clone of the original response object ([Refer to this page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/clone))

For example if your override looks like this:

```ts
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import EmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        EmailPassword.init({
            override: {
                functions: (originalImplementation) => {
                    return {
                        ...originalImplementation,
                        signIn: async function (input) {
                            let response = makeNetworkRequest();
                            // TODO: some custom logic

                            return {
                                status: "OK",
                                user: {...},
                            };
                        },
                    }
                },
            }
        })
    ]
});
```

You will need to modify the function like this:

```ts
...
signIn: async function (input) {
    let response = makeNetworkRequest();
    // TODO: some custom logic

    return {
        status: "OK",
        user: {...},
        fetchResponse: response.clone()
    };
},
...
```

NOTE: If you use the originalImplementation in your overrides, you can access `fetchResponse` from the returned object

```ts
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import EmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        EmailPassword.init({
            override: {
                functions: (originalImplementation) => {
                    return {
                        ...originalImplementation,
                        signIn: async function (input) {
                            let response = await originalImplementation.signIn(input);
                            // TODO: some custom logic

                            return {
                                status: "OK",
                                user: {...},
                                fetchResponse: response.fetchResponse;
                            };

                            // OR return the default implementation
                            // return await originalImplementation.signIn(input)
                        },
                    }
                },
            }
        })
    ]
});
```

2. All recipe functions now return an object instead of returning properties directly. For example:

```ts
async function isEmailVerified(input): Promise<boolean> {...}
```

Now returns

```ts
async function isEmailVerified(input): Promise<{
    status: "OK",
    isVerified: boolean,
    fetchResponse: Response, // Refer to point above
}> {...}
```
