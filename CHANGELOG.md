## [0.15.3] - 2021-08-04

## Fixes

-   https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/issues/299

## [0.15.2] - 2021-07-29

## Fixes

-   Fixes typescript issue with default imports. (Related to https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/issues/297)

## [0.15.1] - 2021-07-16

### Fixed:

-   Handles `Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined` during getting if testing or not.

## [0.15.0] - 2021-07-01

### Fixed:

-   Styling issues with SVG icons
-   In `emailVerificationAuth`, querying for is email verified only if a session exists
-   A few test app issues
-   If visiting auth page with session already existing, then we respect redirectTo query param
-   Uses `useRef` hook when using `withRouter` so that the underlying component is not unmounted.
-   If `redirectToPath` is "", and we are not using react-router-dom, then we redirect to `/`, otherwise we might be stuck in an infinite redirect loop.

## Refactor

-   Uses `SessionAuth` for all our components: https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/issues/241
-   Creates an `AuthWidgetWrapper` component that will redirect login UI if already logged in

### Added

-   Allows for `SessionAuth` to be inside another `SessionAuth`.
-   Updates session context on session changes: https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/issues/228
-   `onSessionExpired` optional prop on `SessionAuth`, `EmailPasswordAuth`, `ThirdPartyAuth` and `ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuth`

### Breaking changes

-   If a component is wrapped in an auth wrapper with `requiredAuth={true}`, and `onSessionExpired` is not provided, then the user will be automatically redirected to the login screen in case of session expiry.

-   The components override API has changed from `(DefaultComponent) => (props) => React.Element` to `({ DefaultComponent, …props }) => React.Element`.

## [0.14.1] - 2021-07-01

    -   Uses redirectToAuth everywhere instead of calling redirect manually.
    -   Adds additional props / config to Session and EmailVerification recipe to make them more isolated
    -   Passes recipe to feature components directly, as opposed to recipeId
-   In session recipe, we remove `setAuth0API` and `getAuth0API`
-   Removes `GET_REDIRECTION_URL` from the possible action types for `getRedirectionURL`.
-   Changes `redirectToAuth` to take an object and adds `redirectBack` param, which can be used to indicate if the user should be redirected to the current page.
-   Removes `getRefreshURLDomain` function from session recipe.
-   Moves `SIGN_OUT` even and pre API hook into the Session recipe.
-   Change to type of `preAPIHook` function
-   Uses supertokens-website version >= 8.0

### Changed
