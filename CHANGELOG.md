## [unreleased]

-   add workflow to verify if pr title follows conventional commits

## [0.18.4] - 2022-01-24

-   swapped out the PureComponent to functional + memo in the files i came across
-   removed the explicit JSX.Element return type, they can be inferred and would probably be better as-is.

## [0.18.3] - 2022-01-23

### Fixes

-   Sends an empty JSON body in email verification token generate API since the content type is application/json + enforces that at least an empty JSON body must be sent in all API calls to the backend.

## [0.18.2] - 2022-01-22

### Changes

-   Fix sample code in docs which gives error "multiple children were provided"
-   Does not modify react router dom object. Instead, we create a new object which contains react-router-dom + custom navigation function.

## [0.18.1] - 2022-01-18

### Changes

-   Removed SuperTokensBranding from the oauth callback screen
-   Makes custom social provider button be a JSX element or a function
-   Changes powered by link to point to `https://supertokens.com?campaign=poweredby`

## [0.18.0] - 2022-01-14

### Changes

-   Extracts away AuthRecipe into one with email verification and one without email verification
-   Updated the reset password form to match the single input forms of passwordless (showing label, removed placeholder and autofocus)
-   Using the default label and no placeholder for the reset password email form instead of the ones configured for the signup form
-   Removed ":" from labels
-   Adds new CSS class for provider button (like `providerGoogle`, `providerApple` etc..) which super seeds `providerButton`.
-   Added a branding element to sign-in/up

### Adds

-   Passwordless recipe

### Fixes

-   Prevents checking of if route can be handled by supertokens on each rerender.

### Breaking changes

-   `getRoutingComponent` now returns ` JSX.Element | null` instead of ` JSX.Element | undefined`
-   Removed ":" from labels
-   Adds new CSS class for provider button (like `providerGoogle`, `providerApple` etc..) which super seeds `providerButton`. So if you are using `providerButton` to change CSS, then you should add a `!important` to it.

## [0.17.9] - 2022-01-07

## [0.15.0] - 2021-07-01

### Fixed:

-   Styling issues with SVG icons

-   A few test app issues
-   If visiting auth page with session already existing, then we respect redirectTo query param
-   Uses `useRef` hook when using `withRouter` so that the underlying component is not unmounted.
-   If `redirectToPath` is "", and we are not using react-router-dom, then we redirect to `/`, otherwise we might be stuck in an infinite redirect loop.

### Refactor
