# SuperTokens EmailPassword Demo app with split sign in and sign up UI

This demo app demonstrates the following use cases:

-   Login (on /signin)
-   Sign up (on /signup)
-   Logout
-   Forgot password flow
-   Session management & Calling APIs

This also showcases how you can use the react component override feature and the CSS customization feature to change our default implementation to what you need.

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run the demo app

This compiles and serves the React app and starts the backend API server on port 3001.

```

The app will start on `http://localhost:3000`
