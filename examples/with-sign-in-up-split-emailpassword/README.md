# SuperTokens EmailPassword Demo app with split sign in and sign up UI

This demo app demonstrates the following use cases:

-   Login (on /signin)
-   Sign up (on /signup)
-   Logout
-   Forgot password flow
-   Session management & Calling APIs

This also showcases how you can use the react component override feature and the CSS customization feature to change our default implementation to what you need.
