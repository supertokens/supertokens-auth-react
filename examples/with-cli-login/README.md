# SuperTokens login to CLI

This demo app demonstrates how we can implement sign in for a CLI client in which it opens the browser and asks you to login there if not logged in already.

## Project setup

Clone the repo, enter the directory, and use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react
cd supertokens-auth-react/examples/with-cli-login
npm install
```

## Run the demo app

This compiles and serves the React app and starts the backend API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run start
```

The app will start on `http://localhost:3000`

Then you can start the cli took by running `./startCLI` command which will prompt you to login.
