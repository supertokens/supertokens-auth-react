                - we find thirdpartypasswordless covers all first factors (but more), save it as fallback

                  Keep in mind, that the passwordless and thirdpartypasswordless recipe provides 4 factors, so this is not an exact match.
                - no other recipes have matching components, so we return the fallback from passwordless

            5. firstFactors: thirdparty, otp-phone, route components from: thirdpartypasswordless, passwordless, thirdparty ->
                - we find thirdpartypasswordless covers all first factors (but more), save it as fallback
                  this is not an exact match, because thirdpartypasswordless provides multiple passwordless factors.
