* SuperTokensRouteWithRecipeId
* Using react-router-dom, we can only match based on the route and not on the combination of path and query params.
* having one route per component would lead to clashes when two components have the same route but different recipeId,
* the first one would always take precedence.
* Hence, the component rendered in the Route is an abstraction that decides which Feature to render based
* on the rId.
* See SuperTokensRouteWithRecipeId below.
